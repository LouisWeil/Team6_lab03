### Load packages

```{r load-packages, message = FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(ggplot2)
```


# Questioning data visualisations

## Image 1

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/Speaking-the-world.jpg")
```

Not proportional, different heights of blocks.




## Image 2

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/rose-pop-density-total-area-bw.jpg")
```

Difficult to compare areas and have no clue what colours mean.



## Image 3

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/life-expectancy-rule-of-law.png")
```

A complete mess, abbr are difficult to understand and everything is jumbled. Colours don't have clear meaning.




## Image 4

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/global-income-dist.PNG")
```

What is going on here, regions are unclear.





# Exercises

```{r load-data-staff, message=FALSE, eval=TRUE}
staff <- read_csv("data/instructional-staff.csv")
```


## Exercise 1

What is the difference between *wide format* data and *long format* data?

Wide is when each variable is listed as its own and column and long is when each unique observation has its own row.

Is the format `staff` data *wide* or *long*?

The staff data is wide.

How many observations are there in the data set?

There are 55 observations in the data set.

## Exercise 2

```{r pivoting}
## Uncomment and complete the following code

staff_long <- staff %>%
  pivot_longer(
    cols = c('1975':'2011'),
    names_to = "year",
    values_to = "percent"
    )

```
staff_long has 55 rows. This corresponds to our answer to exercise 1.

## Exercise 3

```{r dot-plot}
ggplot(data = staff_long,
       mapping = aes(x = year, 
                     y = percent, 
                     colour = faculty_type)) +
  geom_point()

```

```

## Exercise 5

```{r mutate-year}
## Uncomment and complete the following code

#staff_long <- staff_long %>%
#  mutate(year = ______(year))
```
